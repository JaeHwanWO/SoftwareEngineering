# blogobox
blogobox is a blog template made with bootstrap 5. The blogobox template design is inspired by the look of the dev.to.

Blogobox is a blog template made with bootstrap 5 (no need for jQuery) and other supporting components such as sweetalert. The creation of the blogobox template was inspired by the appearance of the dev.to website with 2 sidebars on the left and right and with the main content in the middle.

Blogobox is designed to be clean, developer friendly, SEO Friendly, easy to modify, and others. You will make it easier to modify because the Blogobox template is made with only full bootstrap 5, so you will find it easier to apply what is in the Bootstrap 5 documentation to the Blogobox template. Blogobox is very well suited or recommended for components of creating a website, blog, forum, social media and others.

In version 1.0.0, we provide 4 pages on the blogobox template, namely Home, Post Details, Login and Register. On the Home page, we provide 2 sidebars right and left and in a sticky position. On the top sidebar we provide ads space so that ads are easier to see when opening the website for the first time. Then for the navbar menu we put it on the left sidebar and followed by the tag list below it. On the right side bar, under the ads space we provide a newsletter form to provide space for visitors to register their email. Followed below it is a top article and a category list. And for the content display in the middle, we make it simple by not showing the cover in front of it. In the main content, we provide the Like, Comment and Bookmark icons.

On the Post Detail page, we provide an extraordinary display with a sidebar view that is almost the same as the display on Home, but there is a difference, namely the presence of a share button and a copy to clipboard. The share button can make it easier for users to share existing articles and can also help web owners in promoting their website. Meanwhile, copy to clipboard can assist users in copying URLs without the need for manual copying. For the copy to clipboard feature, we use vanillaJS and sweetalert to enhance the appearance of the pop up when the user has successfully copied the URL.
