I think I'm drowning, asphyxiated
I wanna break this spell that you've created
You're something beautiful, a contradiction
I wanna play the game, I want the friction
You will be the death of me
You will be the death of me
Bury it
I won't let you bury it
I won't let you smother it
I won't let you murder it
Our time is running out
Our time is running out
You can't push it underground
You can't stop it screaming out
I wanted freedom, bound and restricted
I tried to give you up
But I'm addicted
Now that you know I'm trapped Sense of elation
You'd never dream of breaking this fixation
You will squeeze the life out of me
Bury it
I won't let you bury it
I won't let you smother it
I won't let you murder it
Our time is running out
Our time is running out
You can't push it underground
You can't stop it screaming out
how did i come to this?
uuu yeah yeah yeah yeah
uuu yeah yeah yeah yeah
You will suck the life out of me
Bury it
I won't let you bury it
I won't let you smother it
I won't let you murder it
Our time is running out
Our time is running out
You can't push it underground
You can't stop it screaming out
how did i come to this
uuu yeah yeah yeah yeah
uuu yeah yeah yeah yeah
